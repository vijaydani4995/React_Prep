Steps to Check if iisnode Handler is Mapped:
Open IIS Manager:

Press Windows + R, type inetmgr, and press Enter to open the IIS Manager.
Navigate to Your Website:

In the left-hand panel (Connections), expand the Sites node.
Click on your website (the one hosting your Node.js app).
Check Handler Mappings:

In the center panel, double-click on Handler Mappings.
Look for a handler mapping for .js files.
The handler should point to the iisnode module. It typically looks like this:
yaml

Request path: *.js
Executable: %programfiles%\iisnode\iisnode.dll
If iisnode Handler is Not Present:
Add a New Handler Mapping:

In the Handler Mappings section, click on Add Module Mapping on the right panel.
Configure the Handler:

Request Path: *.js
Module: Choose iisnode from the list. If iisnode is not present, you may need to reinstall the iisnode module.
Executable: Enter the path to iisnode.dll. Usually, this is located at:
shell

%programfiles%\iisnode\iisnode.dll
Name: You can give it a descriptive name like iisnode.
Apply the Changes:

Click OK to save the mapping.
Restart IIS:

In IIS Manager, click Restart in the right panel to apply the changes.
This will map all .js files to be handled by the iisnode module, allowing Node.js applications to run under IIS.

Additional Notes:
If iisnode.dll is missing, ensure that iisnode is installed. You can download it from iisnode GitHub or through a package manager like choco if you are using Chocolatey:
Copy code
choco install iisnode
