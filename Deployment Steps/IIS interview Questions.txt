Basic Questions
What is IIS, and what is it used for?

IIS is a web server software developed by Microsoft for hosting websites and web applications. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, and more.
What are the key features of IIS?

Features include:
Application pools
Security (SSL, authentication, etc.)
Logging and diagnostics
URL rewriting
Request filtering
Load balancing
Which protocols are supported by IIS?

HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SMTP, NNTP, WebSocket.
How do you install IIS on a Windows Server?

Via Server Manager:
Open Server Manager.
Click Add Roles and Features.
Select Web Server (IIS).
Follow the prompts to install.
What is an application pool in IIS? Why is it important?

An application pool isolates web applications, ensuring that if one crashes, others are unaffected. It provides better security, performance, and scalability.
Intermediate Questions
What is the default port for IIS, and can it be changed?

Default port: 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.
It can be changed in the binding settings of a site.
How do you host multiple websites on a single IIS server?

By using:
Host headers (different domain names).
Different ports.
Different IP addresses.
What is the difference between an IIS site and a virtual directory?

IIS Site: Represents a full website, with its own bindings and settings.
Virtual Directory: A directory in a site that points to a folder on a disk, potentially on another server.
What is the significance of the web.config file in IIS?

Contains configuration settings for ASP.NET applications, such as:
Authentication modes.
Custom error pages.
Connection strings.
How can you configure HTTPS on IIS?

Steps:
Obtain an SSL certificate.
Install the SSL certificate on the server.
Bind the site to HTTPS in IIS and assign the certificate.
How do you enable logging in IIS?

Go to the site settings in IIS:
Logging > Enable > Set log file location and format.
What are IIS bindings, and what types are available?

Bindings link a site to a combination of IP address, port, and hostname. Types include:
HTTP
HTTPS
FTP
What is worker process recycling in IIS?

Automatically restarts the application pool's worker process to free up resources or apply new configurations. Can be scheduled or triggered by memory limits.
Advanced Questions
How do you troubleshoot a 500 Internal Server Error in IIS?

Check:
IIS logs (stored in C:\inetpub\logs).
Failed Request Tracing (enable it in IIS).
Event Viewer for system/application errors.
Application code for unhandled exceptions.
What is the difference between classic mode and integrated mode in IIS application pools?

Classic Mode: Handles requests using the legacy ISAPI model.
Integrated Mode: Integrates with the ASP.NET pipeline for better performance and extensibility.
How do you configure load balancing in IIS?

Use the Web Farm Framework or external tools like a hardware load balancer, Azure Traffic Manager, or ARR (Application Request Routing).
What is IIS URL Rewrite? Why is it used?

The URL Rewrite module allows you to redirect or rewrite URLs. Useful for:
SEO-friendly URLs.
Redirecting HTTP to HTTPS.
Removing query strings.
What are common security settings in IIS?

Enabling SSL/TLS.
Configuring authentication (Basic, Windows, etc.).
Request filtering (to block malicious requests).
Disabling unused modules.
Setting permissions for files and directories.
What is ARR (Application Request Routing) in IIS?

A module used for reverse proxy and load balancing.
How do you deploy a web application to IIS?

Methods:
Manual copy and configuration.
Using Web Deploy.
Via PowerShell scripts.
What are IIS Modules? Can you name some?

IIS Modules extend the functionality of the server. Examples:
Static Content
HTTP Redirect
Request Filtering
URL Rewrite
Output Caching
How can you improve the performance of a site hosted in IIS?

Techniques:
Enable output caching.
Compress responses using gzip or brotli.
Optimize application pool recycling.
Use static content compression.
Reduce logging verbosity in production.
How does IIS handle authentication?

IIS supports:
Anonymous Authentication.
Basic Authentication.
Windows Authentication.
Forms Authentication (via web applications).
What is the difference between IIS Express and IIS?

IIS Express:
Lightweight and used for local development.
Runs under a user account.
IIS:
Full-featured, used for production hosting.
Runs as a service under the system account.
What are application pool identities, and why are they important?

Application pool identities are user accounts under which the application pool's worker process runs. They provide isolation and enhance security.
Scenario-Based Questions
A website hosted in IIS is slow. How do you troubleshoot? 

Check:
Server resource usage (CPU, RAM).
IIS logs and Failed Request Tracing.
Application performance (database queries, code bottlenecks).
Network latency.
A website works on HTTP but not HTTPS. What could be the issue?

Possible causes:
SSL certificate not installed or expired.
HTTPS binding missing or misconfigured.
Firewall blocking port 443.
How do you deploy multiple versions of an application in IIS?

Create separate application pools and sites for each version.
How would you migrate an IIS website to another server?

Steps:
Export the site configuration using appcmd or PowerShell.
Backup content files.
Import configuration and restore files on the new server.


1. Site
Definition:
A site represents a collection of web applications and their associated content. It is what clients access via a browser.

Purpose:
Hosts websites and handles incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests.

Key Characteristics:

Each site is identified by a unique combination of IP address, port, and host header (bindings).
Contains one or more applications, including the root application.
The root of a site points to a physical directory on the file system (e.g., C:\inetpub\wwwroot).
A site can use a single or multiple application pools for its applications.
Example:

Default Website: The default site in IIS with content stored in C:\inetpub\wwwroot.



2. Application Pool
Definition:
An application pool is a container that isolates web applications. It provides a worker process (w3wp.exe) to handle the requests for those applications.

Purpose:
Ensures isolation and manages resources like memory, CPU, and security for web applications.

Key Characteristics:

Multiple sites or applications can share the same application pool, or each site/application can have its own application pool.
Provides better performance, scalability, and security by isolating applications in separate worker processes.
Applications in one application pool do not affect those in another (e.g., if one crashes, others remain unaffected).
Example:

An application pool named AppPool1 running an e-commerce application.
