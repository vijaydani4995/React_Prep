1. Large Applications with Many Routes (Code Splitting)
Use Case: Your application has multiple pages or features, and not all of them need to be loaded upfront.
Why: To avoid bundling the code for all routes in the initial JavaScript payload.
Example: Load a page component only when the user navigates to that route.
Example with React Router:

import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";

const Home = React.lazy(() => import('./Home'));
const About = React.lazy(() => import('./About'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        </Routes>
      </Suspense>
    </Router>
  );
}

2.Conditional Rendering of Components
Use Case: Components that are only displayed based on user interactions.
Why: No need to load components the user might not use.
Example: A modal or sidebar that opens after a button click.
Example:

jsx
Copy code
const Modal = React.lazy(() => import('./Modal'));

function App() {
  const [showModal, setShowModal] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setShowModal(true)}>Open Modal</button>
      {showModal && (
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading modal...</div>}>
          <Modal />
        </Suspense>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
4. Loading Images and Media
Use Case: Your application has many high-resolution images or videos.
Why: Loading all assets upfront can slow down the page. Instead, load them as users scroll.
Example: Use libraries like react-lazyload or IntersectionObserver.
Example with React Lazy Load:

jsx
Copy code
import LazyLoad from 'react-lazyload';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <LazyLoad height={200} once>
        <img src="large-image.jpg" alt="Lazy loaded" />
      </LazyLoad>
    </div>
  );
}
5. Mobile-First Applications
Use Case: Mobile devices often have slower networks and limited resources.
Why: Reduce the amount of data loaded initially to improve load time on mobile.
6. Dashboard and Analytics Applications
Use Case: Dashboards often contain multiple complex visualizations or charts.
Why: Only load charts for the active tab or section.
Example:


const Chart = React.lazy(() => import('./Chart'));

function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading chart...</div>}>
      <Chart />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
7. E-commerce Applications
Use Case: Product detail pages, reviews, or recommendations.
Why: Load components and images as users browse different products rather than upfront.
8. Progressive Web Applications (PWAs)
Use Case: PWAs often need to work offline or on slow connections.
Why: Lazy load non-critical components to ensure fast initial loading.
9. When Using Third-Party Components
Use Case: Components like maps (e.g., Google Maps) or animations (e.g., Lottie files).
Why: These dependencies can be heavy and are often not critical for the first render.
Example with Google Maps:


const Map = React.lazy(() => import('./Map'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading map...</div>}>
      <Map />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
