Node.js Scenario-Based Questions
File Handling and Performance

Scenario: You are tasked to read a large file and process its data line by line. How would you handle this efficiently in Node.js to avoid blocking the event loop?
Expected Answer: Use fs.createReadStream to stream the file and process it in chunks using the data event. Libraries like readline or stream.Transform can be used for line-by-line processing.
Error Handling

To efficiently process a large file line by line in Node.js without blocking the event loop, you can use streaming. Node.js's fs module provides a createReadStream function to read files in chunks, and you can combine it with the readline module to process the file line by line.

Here’s how you can handle it:

Code Implementation
javascript
Copy code
const fs = require('fs');
const readline = require('readline');

async function processFile(filePath) {
    try {
        // Create a readable stream
        const fileStream = fs.createReadStream(filePath);

        // Use readline to process the file line by line
        const rl = readline.createInterface({
            input: fileStream,
            crlfDelay: Infinity // Handle all newline types
        });

        // Process each line asynchronously
        for await (const line of rl) {
            console.log(`Processing line: ${line}`);
            // Add your processing logic here
        }

        console.log('File processing completed.');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error processing file:', error);
    }
}

// Call the function with the file path
processFile('path/to/large/file.txt');
How It Works
fs.createReadStream:

Reads the file in chunks instead of loading the entire file into memory.
Prevents memory overload for large files.
readline.createInterface:

Processes the stream line by line.
Automatically buffers each line until a newline character is encountered.
for await...of:

Reads each line asynchronously, ensuring the event loop is not blocked.
Benefits
Memory Efficient: Only small chunks of the file are loaded into memory at any time.
Non-Blocking: The use of asynchronous iterators ensures that the event loop can handle other tasks concurrently.
Scalable: Handles large files without performance degradation.
Advanced Use Cases
If you need to pause or resume processing based on external conditions, you can control the readline or stream manually.
To handle errors for specific lines, you can wrap the processing logic inside a try...catch block within the loop.
If multiple lines need to be processed concurrently, you can use a queue system (e.g., async library or Bull) for controlled parallel processing.

Scenario: A function in your Node.js application makes an HTTP request to an external API. Sometimes, the API fails, and your application crashes. How will you handle such errors?
Expected Answer: Use try...catch for synchronous code or .catch() for Promises. Implement retries using libraries like axios-retry or node-fetch-retry for robustness.
Concurrency

const fetch = require('node-fetch');

async function fetchWithRetry(url, retries = 3, delay = 1000) {
    for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= retries; attempt++) {
        try {
            const response = await fetch(url);

            if (!response.ok) {
                console.error(`Attempt ${attempt}: Error Code: ${response.status}`);
                if (attempt === retries) throw new Error('Max retries reached');
            } else {
                const data = await response.json();
                console.log('Data:', data);
                return data; // Exit on success
            }
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Attempt ${attempt}: Request Error: ${error.message}`);
            if (attempt === retries) throw error; // Re-throw if max retries reached
        }

        // Wait before retrying
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
    }
}

// Test the function
fetchWithRetry('https://api.example.com/nonexistent');


Scenario: You need to handle 10,000 parallel incoming requests to a Node.js server. How will you ensure the server doesn’t crash or slow down excessively?
Expected Answer: Implement load balancing using clustering (cluster module) or PM2. Use a queuing mechanism like Bull or RabbitMQ for managing high loads.
Database Connection Management

Scenario: You are connecting to a database using a Node.js application, but it sometimes throws a "too many connections" error. How will you address this?
Expected Answer: Use connection pooling to limit the number of concurrent connections. Libraries like mysql2 or pg support pooling configurations.
Express.js Scenario-Based Questions
Middleware Usage

Scenario: You want to log the details of all incoming requests (method, URL, time) and also validate authentication for certain routes. How would you achieve this in Express?
Expected Answer: Use custom middleware for logging (app.use) and authentication. Separate concerns by applying specific middleware to route groups.
Error Handling

Scenario: How would you set up a global error handler in Express that catches all errors and sends a standardized JSON response?
Expected Answer: Use an error-handling middleware function with four arguments (err, req, res, next). Ensure all routes forward errors using next(err).
Static File Serving

Scenario: You want to serve static files (images, CSS, JavaScript) from a folder named public. How would you implement this?
Expected Answer: Use the express.static middleware like this:
javascript
Copy code
app.use(express.static('public'));
Route Optimization

Scenario: You have multiple routes for fetching data (/api/users, /api/products, etc.), and you want to modularize them. How would you do this?
Expected Answer: Use the express.Router module to separate route handlers into individual files for better maintainability.
Microservices Scenario-Based Questions
Service Communication

Scenario: Two microservices need to communicate—one is written in Node.js and the other in Python. What methods can you use for communication?
Expected Answer: Use REST APIs, GraphQL, or message brokers like RabbitMQ, Kafka, or Redis Pub/Sub for asynchronous communication.
Service Discovery

Scenario: In a microservices architecture, you need a way for services to discover each other dynamically. How will you implement this?
Expected Answer: Use a service registry like Consul, Eureka, or etcd. Alternatively, cloud-native tools like AWS App Mesh or Kubernetes DNS can help.
Data Consistency

Scenario: One service updates a database record, and another service needs to be notified of the change. How will you ensure consistency?
Expected Answer: Use event-driven architecture with tools like Kafka or RabbitMQ to publish changes. Implement eventual consistency through event sourcing or the Saga pattern.
Scaling

Scenario: A single microservice is facing a spike in traffic, and the performance is degrading. What steps would you take to scale it effectively?
Expected Answer: Use horizontal scaling with container orchestration tools like Kubernetes. Implement auto-scaling policies and load balancing.
Security

Scenario: How would you secure communication between two microservices?
Expected Answer: Use TLS for encryption, API Gateway for centralized access control, and OAuth2 for service-to-service authentication.
Rate Limiting

Scenario: One of your microservices is being spammed with requests, leading to degraded performance. How would you implement rate limiting?
Expected Answer: Use libraries like express-rate-limit in Node.js or employ API Gateway with built-in rate-limiting features (e.g., AWS API Gateway).
Failure Handling

Scenario: One microservice is down, but other services are still dependent on it. How will you handle this?
Expected Answer: Use circuit breakers (e.g., opossum library in Node.js), fallback strategies, and retries with exponential backoff.
