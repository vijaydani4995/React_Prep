Complex SQL queries often test your ability to manipulate data across multiple tables, use subqueries, optimize queries, and solve real-world problems efficiently. Here are 10 complex SQL queries commonly asked during interviews, along with explanations.

1. Find the Second Highest Salary
This query tests your understanding of LIMIT, OFFSET, and subqueries.

SELECT MAX(salary) 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
Alternatively:


SELECT salary 
FROM employees 
ORDER BY salary DESC 
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
2. Find Employees Who Earn More Than Their Managers
This query requires joining a table with itself.


SELECT e.name AS Employee, m.name AS Manager
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.id
WHERE e.salary > m.salary;
