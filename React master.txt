âœ… 1. Master the Fundamentals First
ðŸ“Œ These are non-negotiable.

JSX â€“ Writing UI in JavaScript

Components â€“ Functional and Class-based (focus on Functional)

Props & State â€“ Data flow in React

Event Handling â€“ onClick, onChange, etc.

Conditional Rendering â€“ &&, ternary operators

Lists and Keys â€“ Rendering dynamic lists

useState & useEffect hooks â€“ Managing local state and side effects

ðŸŽ¯ Practice: Build a To-Do List, Counter, or Form validation app.

âœ… 2. Learn React Router
For building multi-page apps (SPAs).

<BrowserRouter>, <Routes>, <Route>

useNavigate, useParams, useLocation

Nested routes and protected routes

ðŸŽ¯ Practice: Build a blog with pages or a dashboard with login routing.

âœ… 3. Dive Deep into Hooks
Move beyond useState and useEffect.

useContext

useRef

useReducer

useMemo, useCallback

Custom Hooks

ðŸŽ¯ Practice: Create a theme toggler using context or a form manager hook.

âœ… 4. State Management at Scale
Reactâ€™s local state is limited. Use a state management library when needed.

ðŸ”¥ Redux Toolkit (Recommended) â€“ Learn createSlice, configureStore, createAsyncThunk

Or alternatives like:

Zustand (simple)

Recoil

Jotai

Context API (for light use)

ðŸŽ¯ Practice: Build a shopping cart or project tracker.

âœ… 5. Master API Integration
Every real-world app talks to APIs.

fetch or axios

Loading, success, error handling

Caching libraries: React Query, SWR

Authentication with tokens

ðŸŽ¯ Practice: Build a GitHub user search or weather app.

âœ… 6. Form Handling & Validation
Controlled vs uncontrolled components

Libraries: React Hook Form, Formik

Schema validation with Yup or Zod

ðŸŽ¯ Practice: Build a multi-step registration form.

âœ… 7. Testing React Apps
Use Jest and React Testing Library

Write:

Unit tests (component logic)

Integration tests (user interaction)

Mock APIs

ðŸŽ¯ Practice: Test a form or counter component.

âœ… 8. Performance Optimization
Memoization: React.memo, useMemo, useCallback

Lazy loading: React.lazy, Suspense

Code splitting

Avoiding unnecessary re-renders

âœ… 9. Styling Options
CSS Modules

Styled-components

Tailwind CSS

MUI / Chakra UI

ðŸŽ¯ Practice: Recreate a modern UI layout using a styling framework.

âœ… 10. Real-World Projects
Start building complete apps:

Task Manager

Personal Portfolio

Expense Tracker

Project Management Tool

E-commerce Site

Push to GitHub and deploy via Vercel/Netlify.

ðŸ”„ Bonus Topics (Advanced)
TypeScript with React

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) â€“ Next.js

Static Site Generation (SSG)

Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

GraphQL with Apollo Client

WebSockets for real-time apps
